The IIEF includes 5 domains affecting male sexual function: erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction. Responses to the IIEF were re-coded using a standard coding method, where more positive responses received a higher score. The EF domain score was calculated as the sum of the re-coded scores from questions 1-5 and 15, using last observation carried forward (LOCF). Scores range from 1 (lowest) to 30 (highest). If two or more items in the EF domain were missing, the EF domain score was considered to be missing., Up to Week 12|Mean success rate of insertion based on attempts, Success rate of insertion was derived from the Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) Question 2 (SEP-2) of the participant's diary that asked 'Were you able to insert your penis into your partner's vagina?'. Responses were either Yes or No. Patients were instructed to complete diary questions as soon as possible after each sexual attempt, but no later than 24 hours after the attempt. The per-participant overall success rate for insertion was calculated by dividing the number of successful attempts (SEP-2=yes) over 12 weeks by the total number of valid attempts recorded over 12 weeks. If the participant was not able to make any valid attempts in 12 weeks, the participant was non-evaluable. Per-participant success rates were then averaged at the group level to obtain the mean success rate from Weeks 0-12., Up to Week 12|Mean success rates of maintenance based on attempts, Success rate of maintenance was derived from the SEP Question 3 (SEP-3) of the participant's diary that asked 'Did your erection last long enough for you to have successful intercourse?'. Responses were either Yes or No. Participants were instructed to complete diary questions as soon as possible after each sexual attempt, but no later than 24 hours after the attempt. The per-participant overall success rate for maintenance was calculated by dividing the number of successful attempts (SEP-3=yes) over 12 weeks by the total number of valid attempts recorded over 12 weeks. If the participant was not able to make any valid attempts in 12 weeks, the participant was non-evaluable. Per-participant success rates were then averaged at the group level to obtain the mean success rate from Weeks 0-12., Up to Week 12","Mean duration of erection leading to completion of successful intercourse as measured by Sexual Encounter Profile Question 3 [SEP-3], Duration of erection leading to completion of successful intercourse was derived from data recorded in the participant's diary. For each diary entry, the time from erection perceived hard enough for penetration until withdrawal from partner's vagina was measured by stopwatch and recorded in the participant's diary. For diary entries where SEP-3=yes, this recorded duration was used in calculations of a per-participant median duration. For diary entries where SEP-3=no, a duration of 0 was used to calculate the per-participant median. The per-participant median values averaged at the group level to obtain the mean duration of erection leading to completion of successful intercourse as measured by SEP-3., Up to Week 12|Change from Baseline in scores for questions on the IIEF questionnaire and scores of the other non-EF domains of the IIEF, Non-EF domains of the IIEF (Intercourse Satisfaction, Orgasmic Function, Sexual Desire, Overall Satisfaction) and IIEF questions (Erection during sexual activity?, Hard enough for penetration?, Able to penetrate partner?, Maintain your erection?, Maintain to completion?, Times attempted intercourse, Satisfactory for you?, Enjoyed sexual intercourse?, How often did you ejaculate?, How often feeling of orgasm?, How often felt sexual desire?, Rate level of sexual desire?, How satisfied with sex life?, Satisfied with sexual relationship? and Confidence to get, keep erection?) scores were assessed at Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12. The Baseline was the value at Week 0. Change from Baseline was the post-Baseline value minus Baseline value., Up to Week 12|Number of participants with normal erectile function having EF domain scores of 26 and above, The EF domain score was calculated by summing recoded responses to Questions 1-5 and 15, for each participant. It ranged from 1 to 30. EF domain scores were dichotomized as either normal (26 and above) or below normal (below 26) using LOCF, to calculate number of participants returning to normal erectile function. For the EF domain score the total was considered to be missing if 2 or more answers in the domain were missing., Up to Week 12|Change from Baseline in participant's diary results, Electronic diaries were provided to participants. Participants were supposed to complete the diary questions as soon as possible after each sexual attempt but no later than 24 hours after the attempts. The diary questions (Ability to achieve at least some erection, Ability to insert penis into partner's vagina, Long enough erection having successful intercourse, Satisfied with the hardness of erection, Satisfied with this sexual experience, Ability to ejaculate) response rates were presented for Weeks 0-12. The Baseline was the value at Week 0. Change from Baseline was the post-Baseline value minus Baseline value., Up to Week 12|Mean duration of erection regardless of SEP-3 Response, Duration of erection was time from erection perceived hard enough for penetration (start stopwatch) until withdrawal from the partner's vagina (stop stopwatch) regardless of completion of successful intercourse. The data was presented for overall period from Week 0 to Week 12., Up to Week 12|Change from Baseline in duration of erection leading to completion of successful intercourse., Duration of erection was time from erection perceived hard enough for penetration (start stopwatch) until withdrawal from the partner's vagina (stop stopwatch) leading to completion of successful intercourse. The data was presented for overall period from Week 0 to Week 12. The Baseline was the value at Week 0.

The WPAI:GH outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes, as following 6 questions: 1 = currently employed, 2 = hours missed due to health problems, 3 = hours missed other reasons, 4 = hours actually worked, 5 = degree health affected productivity while working, 6 = degree health affected regular activities.

The test contains 15 questions in 5 domains: (1) Erectile duration/function (questions 01 to 05 and 15); (2) Orgasmic function (questions 09 and 10); (3) Sexual desire (questions 11 and 12); (4) Intercourse satisfaction (questions 06, 07, and 08); (5) Overall sexual satisfaction (questions 13 and 14). The domain-specific scores were calculated as the sum of the scores of the questions in the respective domain; thus, the total score of the Overall Sexual Satisfaction domain was the sum of 2 questions. Score range: 1 to 5 (Q13 and Q14). Total score: 2 to 10. Higher scores reflect better erectile function. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score., Baseline; Week 24|Mean Change From Baseline in the Percentage of ""Yes"" Responses to Questions 1, 4, and 5 of the Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) at Week 24, SEP is a diary in which participants record each sexual attempt made throughout the study and is composed of 5 questions assessing sexual function. Question 1: Were you able to achieve at least some erection?; Question 4: Were you satisfied with the hardness of your erection?; Question 5: Overall, were you satisfied with the sexual experience? The number of ""yes"" response to each question in the SEP was computed as (Sum of all ""yes"" responses to respective SEP question /Total number of responses to that SEP question)\*100.

The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) is a widely used, multi-dimensional self-report instrument for the evaluation of male sexual function. It is has been recommended as a primary endpoint for clinical trials of erectile dysfunction (ED) and for diagnostic evaluation of ED severity. Based on IIEF, ED severity is classified into five categories: no ED (score 22-25), mild (17-21), mild to moderate (12-16), moderate (8-11), and severe (5-7).

Improvements in penile hemodynamics, such as increased blood flow and better vascular function, will be used to gauge the effectiveness of the stem cell therapy in enhancing erectile function.
